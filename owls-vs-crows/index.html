	<h2>Crows Are Smarter</h2>
	<p>American Crows are very social, sometimes forming flocks in the millions. Inquisitive and sometimes mischievous, crows are good learners and problem-solvers, often raiding garbage cans and picking over discarded food containers. They are also aggressive and often chase away larger birds including hawks, owls and herons.</p>
