<h2>Artist. Designer. Musician. Chocoholic.</h2>

<p>Hello there! Only care for the basics? The name is Maria Lauer, age 21, raised in Fall River, MA and currently a junior who attends college at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. Care to know more? Continue...</p>

<p>I am a fine artist and graphic designer. I’ve been drawing for 13 years now experimenting with various mediums and styles but so far realism and surrealism are my favorites. I love drawing human and animal portraits for the joy of bringing them to life through paper. Other than drawing, I am having fun exploring the ever-changing world of communication design. After studying design for three years in high school and three years in college, it has really helped me broaden my skill set and think differently about art. I enjoy creating work that is conceptually driven and can effectively communicate with the audience. Other than reaching people through my work I reach them through my music. I’m a trombonist in the Saint Cecilia Philharmonic Band in Fall River, MA. Whether it’s drawing, designing or performing I absolutely love what I do and want to inspire others to pursue their passions as well.</p>
